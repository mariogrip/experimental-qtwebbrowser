## Experimental WebBrowser

This is based on QtWebBrowser, but ported to QtWebKit (from QtWebEngine) for the time being since Ubuntu touch does not yet support QtWebEngine

On the plus side this is a great test for the "QtWebKit Reloaded" project (https://github.com/annulen/webkit/wiki)

Might be good to have non chromium alternatives :)
